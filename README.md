An R HMM implementation that is mainly coded in c++ and processes sparse Matrix objects.
The main purpose of this package is to asigne chromosomal slice mean expression values of a single cell experiment to one of two classes.
Both classes should also be present in the data.
Probability structures per chromosomal area will be created and every cell will be processed using these criteria.

The core is not even finished (coding started 2020:03:19)

Hope to be finished in about one week.
