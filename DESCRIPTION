Description: This tool identifies chromosomal aberations based on single cell expression data. The data needs to previousely be summed up over certain genomic areas.
Internally it need two lists of vaguely known informations like healthy and cancer cell ids. It will then use the data from these cells to infere expectations about each chromosomal area and will use a HMM algorithm to identify single healthy or cancer cells in the data. In a later step the chromosomal anormalities of 'the cancer cells' are accessed.
