An R HMM implementation that is mainly coded in c++ and processes sparse Matrix objects.
The main purpose of this package is to asigne chromosomal slice mean expression values of a single cell experiment to one of two classes.
Both classes should also be present in the data.
Probability structures per chromosomal area will be created and every cell will be processed using these criteria.

The HMM does work as tested with the IceCone test data. Re-estimation of the probability functions has not been part of the aime here and therefore it is not implemented.

The results need more polish to actually be usable.
